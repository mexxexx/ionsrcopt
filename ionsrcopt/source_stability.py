    """ Classifies all points in the data frame into the categories source stable/unstable, based on a rolling window and a minimum mean and maximum variance in this window.

    Parameters:
        df (DataFrame): The data input loaded as a DataFrame
        current_column (string): name of the column that contains the beam current we are interested in, typically BCT25
        sliding_window_size (int): size of the sliding window, by default 5000 (100 Minutes of data every 1.2 seconds)
        minimum_mean (double): minimal intensity of the beam in the sliding window for it to be considered stable
        maximum_variance (double): maximum variance of intensity of the beam in the sliding window for it to be considered stable

    Returns:
        Series: A series that for every data point indicates if the source was running stable or not (1 is stable, 0 is unstable)
